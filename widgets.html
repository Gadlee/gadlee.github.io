      Agriculture is the backbone of Uganda’s economy, employing over 70% of the population and contributing significantly to the country’s GDP. However, most of Uganda’s farmers are smallholder farmers who rely on traditional practices, word-of-mouth advice, and local observations to make critical agricultural decisions. Despite growing access to mobile phones and internet connectivity, farmers still face a lack of structured access to market information, pricing trends, and reliable forecasting tools. This limits their ability to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Know the best time to plant or harvest based on market demand.</li>
      <li>Identify which market or region offers the best price for their produce.</li>
      <li>Anticipate price drops, demand surges, or export trends that affect profitability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a result, many farmers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell their produce at low prices due to lack of market access.</li>
      <li>Plant late or early based on guesswork, leading to mismatches with peak demand seasons.</li>
      <li>Rely on middlemen, who often offer unfair prices and limited options.</li>
    </ul>
